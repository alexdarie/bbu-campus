; a. Write a function to test whether a list is linear.



; b. Write a function to replace the first occurence of an element E in a given list 
; with an other element O.



; c. Write a function to replace each sublist of a list with its last element. A 
; sublist is an element from the first level, which is a list.
; Example: (a (b c) (d (e (f)))) ==> (a c (e (f))) ==> (a c (f)) ==> (a c f)
; (a (b c) (d ((e) f))) ==> (a c ((e) f)) ==> (a c f)



; d. Write a function to merge two sorted lists without keeping double values.
