## Before a computer is assembled, its vital component (motherboard) goes through ## a special inspection. Only 90% of components pass this inspection. Conduct a ## Monte Carlo study to estimate:#### a. the probability that at least 2 components have to be inspected to find one that passes inspection## b. the expected number of components that have to be inspected to find one that passes it.## Compare your results with the exact values.
