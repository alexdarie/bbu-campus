## A computer processes tasks in the order they are received. Processing a task## is a rare event that occurs at the rate of 3 per minute. Conduct a Monte Carlo## Study to estimate:#### a. the probability that it takes at least 75 seconds to process a package consisting of 5 tasks## b. the average processing time (in seconds) for the entire package## Compare your results with the exact values.
