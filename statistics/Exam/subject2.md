1. There are 10 hot lunches left at a cafeteria, 6 of which are vegetarian. Four students come to lunch late and randomly pick up a plate
  a. (0.5 points) Find the probability that one student got a vegetarian lunch. <br>
  b. (1 point) Find the probability that at most half of the students got a vegetarian lunch. <br>
  c. (1 point) Let X denote the number of students who got a vegetarian lunch. Find the probability distribuiton function X. What type of distribution is it? <br>
  d. (0.5 points) What is the expected number of students getting a vegetarian lunch? <br>
  e. (1.5 points) Prove that 5P(|X| >= 3) <= 4
  
3. Let X1, ..., Xn be a random sample drawn for a distribution with pdf f(x;p) = p^x(1 - x) with x = 0,1, E(X) = p, V(X) = p(1 - p) where p netween 0 and 1 non-inclusive is unknown. <br>
  a. (1.5 points) Find the maximum likelihood estimator, pbar, for p. <br>
  b. (0.5 points) Is it an absolutely correct estimator? Explain. <br>
  c. (1.5 points) Find the efficiency of pbar, e(pbar). <br>
  d. (1 point) At the significance level alpha, find the most powerful test for testing H1: ... against H2: p = 1/4. <br>
