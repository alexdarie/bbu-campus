1. A multiple choice test consists of 10 questions, each having 4 possible answers (only one is correct). A student answers each question randomely.
    a. Find the probability that the student gives exactly 3 wrong answers. <br>
    b. Find the probability that the student passes the test (answers at least 50% of the questions correctly)<br>
    c. Let X denote the number of correct answers given by the student. Find the probability distribution function of X. What type of distribution is it?<br>
    d. What is the expected number of correct answers given by the student.<br>
    e. Show that 32P(1 < 2X < 9) >= 17.
    
 2. let X1, .., Xn be a random sample from Gamma(1, Θ) distribution, with Θ > 0 unknown. (for X ∈ Gamma(a, b), the pdf is f(x; a, b) = (1 / b^(aΓ(a))) x^(a-1) e^(-x/b), x > 0, E(X) = ab, V(X) = ab^2 )
    a. Find the maximum likelihood estimator Θbar, for Θ. <br>
    b. Is it an absolutely correct estimator? Explain. <br>
    c. Find the efficiency of Θ, x(Θbar). <br>
    d. At the significance level alpha ∈ (0, 1), find a most powerful test for testing H0: Θ = 2, against H1: Θ = 1.
