1. The battery of a particular car brand starts with probability 0.95. Find the probability of the following events:
    
    a. A: the battery only starts on the 5th attempt <br>
    b. B: the battery starts on the first at least at least 20 consecutive attempts.

2. Let X ∈ Exp(miu). Find the pdf of Y = √X.

3. Let X1, .., Xn be a random sample drawn from a distribution with pdf f(x; Θ) = (2/Θ^2)x, for 0 < x < Θ, with Θ > 0 unknown.
    
    a. Find the method of moments estimator, Θhat, for Θ. <br>
    b. Is Θhat an absolutely correct estimator? Explain. <br>
