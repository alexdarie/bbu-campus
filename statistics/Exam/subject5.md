1. A basketball player makes a free throw with probability 0.7. Find the probability of the following events: 

    a. (1 point) A: the player makes first free throw only on the 4th shot. <br>
    b. (2 points) B: the player makes the first at least 10 conscutive free throws. <br>
  
2. (2 points) Let X ∈ N(0, 1). Find the pdf of Y = X^2. What type of distribution is it?

3. Let X1, .., Xn be a random sample drawn from a distribution with pdf f(x;Θ) = 1/Θ, for 0 < x < Θ, with Θ > 0 unknown.

    a. (2 points) Find the method of the moments estimator, Θhat, for Θ. <br>
    b. (2 points) Is Θhat an absolutely correct estimator? Explain.
