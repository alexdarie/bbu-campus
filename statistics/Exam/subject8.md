1. A contestant participates in a game show where three important prizes are offered. His chances of winning the three prices are 1/6, 1/3 and 1/2 respectively.

    a. Find the probability that the contestant wins exactly one prize. <br>
    b. Find the probability that the contestant loses at least two prizes. <br>
    c. Let X denote the number of prizes won by the contestant. Find the probability distribution function of X. <br>
    d. How many prizes can the contestant expect to win? 

2. Let X1, .., Xn be a random sample drawn from a Gamma(2, 3Θ) distribution, with Θ > 0 unknown. (for X ∈ Gamma(a, b), the pdf is. f(x;a,b) = ( 1 / (b^a)Γ(a) )x^(a-1)e^(-x/b), x > 0, E(X) = ab, V(X) = ab^2 )
    
    a. Find the maximum likelihood estimator, Θbar, for Θ.<br>
    b. Is it an absolutely correct estimator? Explain.<br>
    c. Find the efficiency of Θbar, e(Θbar).<br>
