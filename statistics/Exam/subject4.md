1. The probability that the battery of a particular car brand does not start is 0.03. Find the probability of the following events: 

    a. (1 point) A : the battery only starts on the 3rd attempt <br>
    b. (2 points) B : the battery starts on the first at least 25 consecutive attempts. <br>
  
2. (2 points) Let X ∈ χ2(2, 1). Find the pdf of Y = √X

3. Let X1, .., Xn be a random sample drawn from a distribution with pdf f(x;Θ) = (1 + Θ)x^Θ, for 0<x<1, with Θ > -1, unknown.
  
    a. (2 points) Find the method of moments estimator, Θhat, for Θ. <br>
    b. (2 points) Find the maximum likelihood estimator, Θbar, for Θ.
