1. The probability of a certain basketball player making a free throw is known to be 0.6. Find the probability of the following events:
    a. A: the player makes his first free throw only on the 5th shot. <br>
    b. B: the player makes the first at least 7 consecutive free throws.
    
2. Let X (2, 1/2). Find the pdf of Y = √X.

3. Let X1, .. Xn be a random sample drawn from a distribution with pdf f(x;Θ) = Θx^(Θ - 1), for 0 < x < 1, with Θ > 0, unknown.

    a. Find the method of moments estimator, Θhat, for Θ. <br>
    b. Find the maximum likelihood estimator, Θbar, for Θ.
