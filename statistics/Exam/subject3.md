1. A software firm produces accounting programs. The probability that one of their programs is defective is 0.2. A chain store purchase 20 accounting programs from that firm.

    a. (1 point) Find the probability that exactly 3 programs are defective. <br>
    b. (1.5 points) Find the probability that at least 80% of the programs are working properly.<br>
    c. (1.5 points) Let X denote the number of programs that are working properly. Find the probability distribution function of X. What type of distribution is it?<br>
    d. (0.5 points) What is the expected number of programs that are working properly?
  
2. Let X1, X2, ..., Xn be a random sample drawn from a Poisson distribution with parameter λ, unknown. Then, for X ∈ P(λ), the pdf is p(x; λ) = ( (λ^x) / x! )e^(-λ), x = 0,1,.., E(X) = V(X) = λ.

    a. (1.5 points) Find the maximum likelihood estimator, λbar, for λ.<br>
    b. (0.5 points) Is it an absolutely correct estimator? Explain.<br>
    c. (1.5 points) Find the efficiency of λbar, e(λbar).<br>
    d. (1 point) At the significance level α ∈ (0,1), find the most powerful test for testing H0: λ = 1 against H1: λ = 2<br>
