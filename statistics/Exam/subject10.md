1. There are 30 computers in a classroom, 4 of which are very slow, 20 students come to class and are seated randomly each in front of a computer. 
    a. Find the probability P that none of the slow computers are used. <br>
    b. Find the probabikity P that at most half of the slow computers are used.<br>
    c. Let X denote the number of computers that are being used. Find the pdf of X. What type of distribution is it?<br>
    d. What is the expected number of components being used?<br>
    e. Show that 9P(-3 < X < 3) >= 1

2. Let X1, .., Xn be a random sample drawn from an exponential distribution with parameter λ > 0, unknown. (for X ∈ Exp(λ), the pdf is f(x, λ) = (1/λ)e^(-x/λ), x > 0, λ > 0, E(X) = λ, V(X) = λ^2).<br>
    a. Find the maximum likelihood estimator, λbar for λ.<br>
    b. Is it an absolutely correct estimator? Explain.<br>
    c. Find the efficiency of λbar, e(λbar).<br>
    d. At the signficance level alpha ∈ (0, 1), find a most powerful test for testing H0: λ = 1, H1: λ = 2. <br>
